# TODO

* currently festivals.html is dynamically created. its probably wise to still have a backup that i can serve statically so main page is much more stable?
* working on the update-next-lot and the sold_out attribute of event.
Need to design way of adding this information to the page
* make base pydantic base (abc) class
* clean up script folder -> split into reasonable folders
* Docstrings at the begging of each module
* make id in User database the normal counter for db insertions and instead add email field
