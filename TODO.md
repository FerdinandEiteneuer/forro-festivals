# TODO

* currently festivals.html is dynamically created. its probably wise to still have a backup that i can serve statically so main page is much more stable?
* working on the update-next-lot and the sold_out attribute of event.
Need to design way of adding this information to the page
* clean up script folder -> split into reasonable folders
* Docstrings at the begging of each module
* make id in User database the normal counter for db insertions and instead add email field
* backup system does not work anymore on pythonanywhere? nothing of february is there
* why does forro-app query take 60 seconds?
* next lot thing randomly appearing... oops
* do not insert forro-app events that are already there. There is no real problem here, the code works, but the ids keep growing unnecessarily
* maybe import error in update db task . anyways its paused now
