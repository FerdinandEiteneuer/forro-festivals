    <p>Hey Forrozeir@s! ðŸŽ‰</p>

    <p>I put together this list of upcoming forrÃ³ festivals, and I hope you find it helpful too! ðŸ˜Š</p>

    <p>Big thanks to the awesome folks at the <a href="https://www.forro-app.com">ForrÃ³ Events App</a> for letting me use their data.
        If you want your festival to show up here, just add it to the app!
        This list syncs with the app's data once a day, so it'll stay updated.
    </p>

    <p>If you are an organizer, I recommend directly using the ForrÃ³ app, but you can also head over to <a href="/add-festival">Add Festival</a>
        if you'd like to add a festival directly to this list.
    </p>
